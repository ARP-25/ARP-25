# 👋 Hi, I'm Angelo!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate full stack software developer based in Germany. My journey into the world of coding started with my studies in Mechatronics, where I discovered my love for software development. I further honed my skills through a bootcamp and the Code Institute for Full Stack Software Development, and I've been working as a freelance software developer ever since.

## 🌟 Interests
- **Full Stack Web Development**: Specializing in React, Next.js, and Django.
- **Quantitative Trading**: Currently researching and automating trading strategies.

## 🌱 Current Learning
My main focus is to become highly proficient with Next.js due to its numerous benefits, including server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance, static site generation (SSG) for faster load times, and enhanced SEO capabilities. Additionally, When there is some time left in the day I'm also working on enhancing my expertise in researching and automating trading strategies.

## 💞️ Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on projects related to full stack web development and quantitative trading. If you have an exciting project or idea, let's connect and make something great together!

## ⚡ Random Facts
When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books on a variety of subjects 📚. I also love taking long walks in nature 🌲, going on mountain bike tours 🚴, or lifting weights at the gym 💪 to balance out my time spent on the computer. I've also become interested in the benefits of saunas 🥵 and cold plunges ❄️.
